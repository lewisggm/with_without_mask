# with_without_mask

This is a simple notebook that classifies images with and those without masks.

All the data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/niharika41298/withwithout-mask).

I used tensorflow to create a neural network that helped in the classificaton.

It managed to have an accuracy of 98%, validation_accuracy of 92%.

I then sampled the test that that was then predicted. Plotted the images where a blue title meant the prediction was right and red meaning the prediction was wrong.
